1. Plan Your Components
Given the structure of your app, you can organize it into several key components:
Calendar Component: This could be the main component that handles the state and logic for the current view (year, month, week) and displays the relevant data.
YearView Component: Displays years in a vertical scrolling fashion. Each year can be a clickable item that takes you to the respective Year's detail view.
MonthView Component: Shows months in a vertical scrolling fashion, with a sneak peek of the calendar for that month. Clicking a month could take you to the detailed Monthly view.
WeekView Component: The most interactive part, showing a detailed view of the week. This is where users can add, edit, or view their plans and events.
2. Start with Static Components
Implement Static Views: Begin by creating static versions of your YearView, MonthView, and WeekView components. Don't worry about dynamic data yet; just get the layout and styling right.
Use Mock Data: To simulate how your components will work with real data, use mock data. This can help you build your components without needing the backend setup initially.
3. Add Dynamic Behavior
State Management: Introduce state management within your components. For instance, use React's useState to handle the current date, selected view, and any events or plans.
Navigation Between Views: Implement the logic to navigate between year, month, and week views. This could involve updating the state to reflect the current view and passing the appropriate data to each component.
4. Implement Interactivity for the WeekView
Event Handling: Add functionality to add, edit, and delete events in the WeekView. This will likely be the most complex part of your application in terms of state management and UI updates.
Form Inputs: For adding or editing events, consider using modal dialogs or inline forms with inputs for event details.
5. Add Transitions and Animations
Research Transitions: Look into React libraries that can help you implement the transitions, such as react-spring for spring-based animations or framer-motion for more complex animations.
Implement Gradually: Start with simple animations, like fading between views or sliding transitions for navigating between the year, month, and week views. Then, gradually increase the complexity of your animations as needed.
6. Refinement and Testing
Responsiveness: Ensure your app looks great on various devices by using responsive design principles.
User Testing: Get feedback on the usability and aesthetics of the app. User feedback can be invaluable in refining the transitions and overall user experience.
7. Consider Future Enhancements
Adding a Backend: Later on, you can add a backend to store user events and allow for account creation. This would involve learning about RESTful APIs or GraphQL, databases, and authentication.
